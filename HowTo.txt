Note:

When the variable internal refresh rate (FpS; frames per second) is close to your screen refresh rate you may notice that the aiming line shows some flicker or even disappears completely. This effect is due to the beat interference between the two frequencies and is an inherent problem with discrete frame displays. You have the same effect in movies for example when the spokes of a wheel seem to stand still or even turn backwards.
