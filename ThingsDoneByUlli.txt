Removed dead Subs/Functions/Properties
Renamed some variables
Bug: removed 8Ball from pocket on restart game
Moved all auxilary file names to constants
Skip missing auxilary files
Enlarged pockets
Introduced a "pocket attractor" to make sinking more realistic
Reduced bumper elasticity
Removed friction pysical constant
Lowered aiming camera
Moved number of transition frames and aiming elevation to constants
Replaced all constant references to ball radius by physical constant from class
Reduced specular on wood
Moved light to above center of table
Added ambient lighting
Played with shadows
Modified initial ball positions and inaccuracy
Introduced a bit of randomness into initial cue ball velocity
Added spin effect on collisions to preserve rotational inertia
Changed rotation pitch limiting 
Enabled full screen view and form resizing [and removed a (new) bug in minimizing form]
Kept rendering active on game end (so resize will work)
Removed UpdateCamPos-call from UpdateBillards because the camera is not moving then
Show/hide cursor
Increased zoom range
Changed delay loops to use GetTickCount
Corrected camera transition to stop at zero (not at 1) frames left
Optimized some code
Changed time raster to 30 millisecs for slower machines and better collision detection
Removed 'End' statement in mdlPlay
Re-colored some balls
Changed table body color to match top
Changed table cloth material and bumper color
Changed power and panel pics color
Changed 'Shoot' label 
Played with lblPlayer
Added some function keys as menu shortcuts
Made aiming line optional
Changed device background to match viewport forecolor (to blend in aiming line)
Made aiming line to start at cueball
Made shooting power percentage time dependent
Added keyboard aiming cam movement (Up - Down - Left - Right, PageUp - PageDown, Enter)
Changed compile options
Added copyright label
Added About Box
----------------------------------------------------
Added slow motion
Played with mouse cursor icons
Modified Camera transition path
Added more keyboard control
Removed a few minor quirks and inconsistencies
Altered time raster
Added Good Bye sequence
Added Startup delay
Changed rotational inertia effect on ball-bumper collisions
Moved some code to more convenient places
----------------------------------------------------
Bound internal master clock to high speed performance counter
Made master clock self adjusting to speed of CPU and speed of rendering
Blinking is now controlled by the shooting power timer
Added Initial loop game stage (idling)
More and better noises
More code streamlining
Re-colored bumpers and some balls
Bumbers now have a sightly different shape
Added commercial stamp on cue ball
Lights off at end of game and back on at (re-)start of game
Changed shooting power controls
Decreased roll friction by a few percent
Fixed game end condition when the cue-ball was sunk instead of the 8-ball
Fixed the rare case when eight ball pocket selection follows free ball
Different camera transition algorithm
Made CamInTransit Public and changed loops waiting while cam is in transit
Changed cue-ball re-appear when cam is already in place
Same with 8-ball hole designation
Added frmFreeze
Added About Box
Added frmWinTerm
Added shoot and sink counters
Removed all Late Binding
Cam transit to fixed cam posn is faster now
Added cam transit on new game
Moved the spotlight a little off the center
Increased ball rotational inertia
Fixed a long standing quirk regarding the camera position and viewing angle 
                                  with cueball near the center of the table
Fixed bug with "AndTheWinnerIs"
Added "Undo last shot" functionality
----------------------------------------------------
Added Joystick
Added Cheat Mode
Fixed bug when New Game is called while in "Select 8-Hole" state
----------------------------------------------------

Things still to do:
Auto aiming (computer's turn)
Chalk on table border :-)

Have fun and happy hacking
